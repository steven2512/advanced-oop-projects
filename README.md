# Pocket Monsters: Advanced Object-Oriented Programming & Algorithmic Design

Pocket Monsters is a Python implementation of a modular battle system inspired by complex turn-based games. It models teams of autonomous entities engaging in combat, with support for dynamic team management, type-effectiveness logic, and multi-mode battle simulations.

This project is engineered under strict constraints prohibiting Python built-in containers (lists, dictionaries, sets) to demonstrate advanced object-oriented design, abstraction, and custom data structures for deterministic performance.
